# Trevor's Portfolio

## Description

This project is the beginning of a portfolio for future employers to look at my work and information about me.

This project reinforced the fundamentals of HTML and CSS, and how to apply them in the real world. It made me think outside of the box in order to bring my wireframe website to life.

Not only did this project teach me a lot, but it also is a great template to use and build off of for a real portfolio to use in the future.
